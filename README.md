- "Plumbing Fittings Count" reads the images from the folder, calculate the counts and detect the anomaly
- "Tracking Video Count" reads the video instead of images, track all the fittings, count and provide alert if any anomaly present
- "Conveyor Trigger Count" integrate the python code with Arduino UNO and read the frame when arduino triggers (It triggers when it finds new section in Conveyor Belt)
